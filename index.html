        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a Software Engineer who graduated from Epicodus and worked under Hubb as an Angular Development Intern. I graduated in the class of 2016 from Reynolds High School, and initially wanted to pursue a theatre arts degree, 
          as I had realized I had a passion for it just before I graduated. I went to school at Clackamas Community College, Mt. Hood Community College, and
          South Puget Sound Community College for 4 years, until the COVID-19 Crisis shut down my campus in Olympia. I took interest in coding, as I had enjoyed taking it along grahpic design in high school. 
          My cousin is also a software engineer, and after hearing about the amazing projects I could work on myself,
          enrolled myself in Epicodus's Mobile and Web Design Bootcamp. I graduated from Epicodus in March 2021 with a certification
          in web and mobile design. I find myself most interested in Front-End development, Animation, Game-Design and UI/UX Design, as it provides a fun challenge in creating something that is visually distinct, yet effiecient to use!
          </p>
        <p>My current interests include video games, Delta Green, drawing, and guitars! I also enjoy theatre arts and I've acted in 7 shows on stage, as an extra in "Documentary Now!", and even
          the webseries "Fallen Justice." I also acted in "Dinner Detective Portland", an improv-based murder-mystery
          company for 2 years. Some of my favorite bands include Sybreed, Periphery, Perturbator, Celldweller, and A Day to
          Remember, with metal being my favorite genre. I currently reside in Southeast Portland and I work for Nectar Cannabis as a Logistics Specialist and Intake Team member.</p>

        <h2>Noteworthy Projects</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/GarrettBrown-dev/Dungeon_Darkly">Dungeon_Darkly</a>
              <p>An MUD (Multi-User-Dungeon) Game created by me and 4 other Epicodus students for our first team week! I
                worked on the old-style computer terminal UI, enemies placed in rooms and their stats, and room descriptions!
                Created with: <span class="highlight">HTML, CSS, Javascript, Canvas, Node.JS, and Git.</span></p>
          </li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/GarrettBrown-dev/Dungeon_Darkly_Unity">Dungeon_Darkly_Unity</a>
              <p>The new and improved version of Dungeon_Darkly based on the legendary Unity Engine! I assisted in the
              creation of the UI to get it to look like a simple screen and scroll as the JS version did! Created with:
              <span class="highlight">Unity Engine, C#, Git.</span></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/GarrettBrown-dev/RpgCompendium">RPG Compendium</a>
            <p>A database intended for use alongside Dungeon_Darkly. With this, you can add items, monsters and more to the
              list of things encountered in-game. I styled this page, and helped with the connections to the MySql database.
              Created with: <span class="highlight">C#, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and MySql.</span></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/GarrettBrown-dev/choose-your-own-adventure">A Day at Epicodus</a>
            <p>A lovely flowchart-esque site that shows the general day for an Epicodus student. This site was meant to be
            an exploration of React animations and styling capabilities, but ended up becoming a fun nod towards our time
            spent in class.
            Created with: <span class="highlight">Javascript, React, React Spring, CSS, HTML, jQuery, Node.JS, and
            Git.</span></p>

            <a href="https://github.com/GarrettBrown-dev/Radiolaria">Radiolaria</a>
            <p>My capstone project for Epicodus. This project was an attempt at recreating "Hanenbow", a template for the
            sound-based Nintendo DS game, Electroplankton. It also includes several coding excercises from projects and
            technologies I had wanted to use for it. This project cemented in my mind what I wanted to do as a software
            developer, and that was make unique experiences for a person to enjoy through sound, animation, and gameplay!
            I fully intend to work on this project in my off time, creating the other templates in the original game, and
            furthering my skills in what I love! Created with: <span class="highlight">Javascript, Matter.js, Tone.js,

           my mentor, Grant Eadie, the marketing department and their CEO Robert Norton to create this feature! The backend is Angular based, and allows the users to change 
           the colors and logos according to a company's desired color scheme via state variables that are connected to an event-config JSON file! This product was built over 
           10 weeks and has already been purchased by 2 companies! I assisted in creating Snake-Eater, and the arcade splash page!
